hi there my name is dr. Dominic Rowley and I'm the medical director of let's catch a comm today we're going to talk to you about HIV HIV is caused by a virus called HIV that stands for human immunodeficiency virus this virus is a virus that attacks your immune system namely your T cells your T cells are the infection fighting cells in your body and these give us our ability to fight a lot of common bacteria and viruses and fungal infections so when you have HIV your body's ability to fight infection is impaired or compromised HIV is contracted in a number of different ways the most commonly known a bad way I suppose is through unprotected sex it through and bodily fluids namely semen and vaginal secretions it's also transmitted through blood so from infected blood products of the sharing of infected needles or dirty needles is also known so what are the signs and symptoms of HIV infection well no two people are the same but the vast majority of people will develop what we call a seroconversion illness or a classic flu-like illness about two to six weeks after you come in contact with the virus and this is when your the HIV virus has infected your lymph glands and your immune system is fighting against the virus so most people will present with the severe flu so temperature muscle pains and aches you know they won't be able to get off the couch they won't be able to go to work and other people will present with the diarrheal illness I think they've got a gastroenteritis so very severe diarrhea or maybe vomiting other people would present with swollen lymph glands in their neck or under their armpit or in their groin or other people would present with a rash because this looks like many other viral infections people often don't go to their doctor and get tested and instead they treat themselves with home remedies such as paracetamol or aspirin and get through this stage so after the acute stage so as I mentioned here two to six weeks after coming in to counter the virus he who developed this flu-like illness possibly if you don't go and get tested the virus then becomes silent or dormant in the body and this is when I suppose you are this can take two to ten years before you will develop any signs of of what what is commonly known as as AIDS which is or an immune deficiency syndrome where your immune system is really compromised and you're a very high risk of infection of through bacteria or viruses or fungal infections this is the later stage of HIV infection and as I mentioned this can take up to 2 to 10 years to present itself after and been infected so patients are people often ask me sir who's at risk of HIV infection and who should get tested well the first thing I would say is everybody should get tested its we all should have tested when we're leaving the relationship or starting a new relationship or if we think we've had a high-risk encounter and by that I mean of course an unprotected sexual encounter and however there are certain groups that are a higher risk and of HIV infection those would include men who sex and man and people who share needles are intravenous drug users or indeed people who would share needles for steroid use and they would be classed as and slightly higher risk patients for contracting HIV if you're concerned about vo that you come into content with HIV or indeed you might be a risk of HIV infection please visit let's get Jack calm and speak with one of our nurses and they'll be really happy to advise you about which test will best suit your needs
