hi there my name is dr. Dominic Rowley and I'm the medical director of let's get checked I'm here today to talk to you about hepatitis C infection so what is hepatitis C when hepatitis C is one of the member of the hepatitis virus families so there's HEPA there's a number of these different viruses including hepatitis A B C D and E hepatitis C is on the most commonly found types of hepatitis virus in the Western world I was hepatitis C contracted or transmitted from one person to another well the most common way is transmitted through the infected blood so by this I mean infected blood that you can yet you can be exposed to to a number of different ways for example infected blood products this rarely happens nowadays because of all blood products are rigorously screened and the other way it can happen is two sharing of infected or dirty needles so for intravenous drug users this can be a problem and for people who share and needlessly inject steroids this can also be a significant issue and hepatitis C you can be transmitted through dirty needles for example if they need people who are getting frequent tattoos and the needles aren't changed between each client this can also be a source of hepatitis transmission occasionally hepatitis C you can be transmitted sexually so this is far less common than hepatitis B most people that are exposed to hepatitis C could become chronic carriers and the minority of patients their own immune system cares the virus itself so unlike hepatitis B it's pretty much the opposite appetize B most patients the hepatitis B care at themselves and don't become chronic carriers whereas most patients with hepatitis C become chronic carriers and don't clear themselves and that's why it's so important to get tested so how does hepatitis C manifest itself or what signs and symptoms appear in patients with hepatitis C well in the acute stage when you first get infected the hepatitis C you either may not notice it at all or you may develop a flu-like illness extreme fatigue fever you may develop abdominal pain particularly here over the liver area and you may develop a jaundice or yellowing of the eyes and you may develop an itch related to the jaundice in the more chronic stage of hepatitis the reason it's so dangerous as a virus is because it leads to inflammation of the liver which is called hepatitis and if this is untreated hepatitis will lead to a condition called cirrhosis which is taking or fibrosis of the liver where it becomes less able to metabolize and clear toxins from the body if this stage is left untreated hepatitis C if if chronic and the patient has developed cirrhosis it can lead to a much increased rate of hepatocellular cancer or liver cancer so hi was hepatitis C diagnosed so hepatitis C is only diagnosed with the use of the blood test if you're worried that you've come into contact with hepatitis C or been exposed to hepatitis C or I have had sexual intercourse as somebody with hepatitis C or in do you worry that you have it please go onto our website let's get checked speak with one of our nurses and they'll advise you about the best test that's suited to your needs
